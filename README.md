> Font use is direct, not scripted for system, or in by system software.

> Non-vector font has space unicode removed.

> Fonts were made to work apart from system, or change the use of font to the user.
> [!Caution]
> With non-vector font, many language unicode blocks' font fallback is system font(s)
