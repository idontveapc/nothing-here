the font files are edited to be used as custom font(s)
in any android app(s) that has the feature.

not recommended to use as system font but it's might work
as a font, also some emojis would be broken too.

as some of emojis won't be shown correctly, &, ON ANDROID
APP(s), IT WOULD FALLBACK TO SYSTEM EMOJIS AS FOR TEXT 
GLYPHS & CHARACTERS SYSTEM FONT WOULD BE USED SO THAT FOR
SOME EMOJIS TOO BECAUSE SOME EMOJIS CHARACTERS ARE TEXT 
CHARACTERS. so such it's edited for as in-app font.

they're not compat font(s) so android app(s) dev(s) should
stick with noto emoji repo on github, working compat font 
is there.
